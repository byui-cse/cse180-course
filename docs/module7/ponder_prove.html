    <p>
        Up to now, you've focused, primarily, on algorithms others use. This final task is to self-reflect on your own algorithms. To accomplish this, select 3 algorithms that you use in your daily educational, spiritual, and personal life. You will need to evaluate each algorithm for its Big O complexity, propose an improved alternative, and calculate the Big O complexity for the improved algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure you include the discrete steps of your algorithm. If you have less than 5 steps, your algorithm probably doesn't take enough into account - you need to increase the scope of your algorithm. Remember our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN2RM-CHkuI" target="_blank">Peanut Butter & Jelly example</a> - someone else should be able to follow the steps of your algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
        An Improved algorithm either takes less time or produces a better result. Taking less time does not mean that the Big O will necessarily change, but it could.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last and most important part of your task is to record insights that you learned from exploring these algorithms and improvements. Which of these improved algorithms are you actually going to implement? What will you save by implementing them? What other processes in your life have you been prompted to change as a result of exploring and identifying these?
    </p>

<h2>Task Summary</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spend 30 minutes pondering on the following areas: educational, spiritual, and personal life</li>
        <li>Record an algorithm from each area</li>
        <li>Record an improvement for each algorithm with steps listed</li>
        <li>Determine the efficiency of the 6 algorithms using Big O notation</li>
        <li>Record your thoughts, impressions, and insights as you evaluated your algorithms and the improved versions</li>
        <li>Don't forget to complete the <a href="grade_claim.html" target="_blank">final grade claim</a> as well</li>
        <li>Prepare to share your notes with your classmates
        </li>
