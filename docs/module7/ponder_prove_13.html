    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>

<h1>Project Week!</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        In weeks 1 through 7 you focused, primarily, on algorithms others use. This week do some self-reflection on your own algorithms. To accomplish this, select a few algorithms that <b>you</b>
        use in your daily educational, spiritual, or personal life. Pick one of these,
        evaluate its Big Oh complexity, propose an improved alternative, and calculate the Big Oh complexity of the improved algorithm.

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the algorithm you selected. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What other algorithms did you consider?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps you initially used?</li>
            <li>Why did you choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, steps of your improved algorithm?</li>
            <li>What are the Big Oh complexities of each algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
