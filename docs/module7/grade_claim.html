<h1>Grade Claim Task</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Ponder your experience in the class and write a self-assessment report, including the final grade you will claim for the course, taking into consideration the feedback you got from your peers, the definitions of A, B, C, and D below, and how they relate to the outcomes for the class and for the university.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't write an epistle. You should have 3-4 paragraphs that give well-documented evidences as to why the grade you are claiming is the correct grade for you this semester.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should probably have a paragraph talking about how you achieved course objectives, using the task assignments and peer evaluations as evidence. Another paragraph might show how you've become an <a href="https://www.byui.edu/byu-idaho-learning-outcomes#ec" target="_blank">Effective Communicator</a> and <a href="https://www.byui.edu/byu-idaho-learning-outcomes#sc" target="_blank">Skilled Collaborator</a> by showing your attendance and participation on report days as well as regular days. You might have a paragraph that outlines your achievement of the course objectives by highlighting changes that you've made in your life and ways that you've used the lessons you've learned in this class. Your last paragraph should have the grade that you claim.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you've written and submitted your grade claim, meet with your instructor to discuss and finalize your grade in the class. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My algorithm for evaluating the grade claim is as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Read your grade claim</li>
            <li>Review your peer evaluations from your tasks</li>
            <li>Verify that you've achieved the course objectives with a combination of the following
                <ul>
                    <li>Check final project</li>
                    <li>Examine other task reports</li>
                    <li>Discuss key concepts with you</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>BYU-Idaho Grade Definitions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                "A" represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                "B" represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be successful in next level courses, graduate school or employment. The student participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.
           <p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                "C" represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses could be attempted but mastering new materials might prove challenging. The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                "D" represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.
           </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
