    <h1>CSE 180: Week 12</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>

<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<p>
    Goal this week: Explore how to use calculation to assess and classify
    compression algorithms by their efficiency.
</p>

<p>
    You are given these descriptions and a one- or two-word jargon label for
    different but related types of algorithms:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
    <li>One constant operation reduces the problem size by one — Linear.</li>
    <li>One pass through the input reduces the problem size by one — Quadratic.</li>
    <li>One constant operation reduces the problem size by half — Logarithmic.</li>
    <li>One pass through the input reduces the problem size by half — Linear Logarithmic.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    You have two tasks this week. The first is to analyze the text compression algorithm you learned in class and
    determine which of these four types best describes it. The second is to examine the algorithms you have collected
    in your interviews with your loved ones and aquaintances. Is there any algorithm they were using that could be
    improved by applying the algorithm you saw in class to do text compression? The algorithm can be used to do
    things other than text compression.&#x1F600;

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure you take notes on the analysis you do outside of class.</li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your notes and discoveries about
            the algorithm you assessed.</li>
    </ul>
