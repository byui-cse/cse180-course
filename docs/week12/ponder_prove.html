    <h1>CSE 180: Week 12</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>

<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<p>
    Goal this week: Explore how to use calculation to assess and classify
    compression algorithms by their efficiency.
</p>

<p>
    You are given these descriptions and a one- or two-word jargon label for
    different but related types of algorithms:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
    <li>One constant operation reduces the problem size by one — Linear.</li>
    <li>One pass through the input reduces the problem size by one — Quadratic.</li>
    <li>One constant operation reduces the problem size by half — Logarithmic.</li>
    <li>One pass through the input reduces the problem size by half — Linear Logarithmic.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    You have two tasks this week. The first is to analyze the text compression algorithm you learned in class and
    determine which of these four types best describes it. The second is to examine the algorithms you have collected
    in your interviews with your loved ones and aquaintances. Is there any algorithm they were using that could be
    improved by applying the algorithm you saw in class to do text compression? The algorithm can be used to do
    things other than text compression.&#x1F600;

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
            <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
