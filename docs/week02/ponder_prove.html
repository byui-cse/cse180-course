<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<h2>Order vs. Disorder</h2>

	<div>
<p>
    There are many life lessons you learn when you use algorithmic thinking to bring more order to your life.
</p>

<p>
    What you are doing this week is being mindful of the order and disorder you experience as part of your daily life.
</p>

<p>
    For this exploration, think about the many things you do every day. You will discover there are many algorithms you are using that you may not have recognized before. Remember the example of getting dressed? What you&rsquo;re looking for doesn&rsquo;t need to be more complicated than that.
</p>
<p>
    After identifying the algorithms your friends and family use, figure out the O-notation for the algorithms wrote down.
</p>

<p>
    In class you have learned the basics of O-notation (Order of growth). You saw how it pertains to the case where the algorithm can&rsquo;t get any worse. (Mathematically, the &ldquo;worst possible case&rdquo; is actually easier to analyze than a &ldquo;typical case.&rdquo;)
</p>
    
<p>
    You also learned about the bubble sort and the merge sort algorithms.
</p>
    
<p>
    To compare two sorting algorithms, you need an objective measure of the work
    each does. Say that the unit of work is to compare one item in a collection
    of items to another. Doing this work tells you if one item comes before or
    after another. If so you must swap their order, or do nothing if they compare
    the same.
</p>
    
<p>
    Do this experiment. Shuffle a standard deck of cards. Give someone who is
    not in the class the deck and ask them to sort the cards by looking at each
    card one at a time. Count the number of times they compare one card to another.
</p>
    
<p>
    See if you can figure out what algorithm they&rsquo;re using, and what the
    O-notation for it would be.
</p>
    
    <p> 
    The idea is to measure the total work they do and relate that to the size of
    their sorting task (the number of cards in this case).
</p>

<div>
    <h2>Algorithm for doing this task</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Interview one or two friends, family members, or roommates
            <ul><li>Take notes so that you can write a report later</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Obtain 2 algorithms that they use in their life that they've never realized before</li>
        <li>Observe their sorting of a deck of cards - counting the number of comparisons</li>
        <li>Combine your notes into a report that you will share with your classmates during class next Wednesday</li>
        <li>
            Your report should include
            <ul>
                <li>Who you talked with</li>
                <li>The discrete steps of the algorithms your acquaintances' algorithms</li>
                <li>What the <em><strong>n</strong></em> refers to when talking about the efficiency of the algorithm</li>
                <li>The Big O notation for the efficiency of the algorithm</li>
                <li>Insights about why they do it that way or how could they improve the algorithm</li>
                <li>The results of card sorting task and its Big O efficiency</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Submit your report to the Week 3 Ordering Report assignment <strong>before</strong> class</li>
        <li>Attend class on Wednesday to share your report with 4-5 of your classmates</li>
    </ol>
