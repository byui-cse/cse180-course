    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>

<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<h2>Order vs. Disorder</h2>

	<div>
<p>
There are many life lessons you learn when you use algorithmic thinking to
bring more order to your life.
</p>

<p>
What you are doing this week is being mindful of the order and disorder you
experience as part of your daily life.
</p>

<p>
For this exploration, think about the many things you do every day. You will
discover there are many algorithms you are using that you may not have
recognized before. Remember the example of getting dressed? What you&rsquo;re
looking for doesn&rsquo;t need to be more complicated than that.
</p>

<p>
Talk to the same people you did last week, or different people if you prefer,
to discover what algorithms they use. Use this as an opportunity to discuss
with them what you learned about yourself, and what you know about
algorithmic thinking so far. Once again, make sure you take notes on these
conversations you have outside of class.
</p>

<div>
<h2>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h2>
<div>
    <ul>
<li><p>
    Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
    <ul>
        <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
        <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
        <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
        <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
    </ul>
    Do not limit yourself to these questions.
    </p>
</li>
<li>Share with your team your report and
discoveries about the algorithms you found that those you love use to bring order to and improve their lives.</li>
</ul>
