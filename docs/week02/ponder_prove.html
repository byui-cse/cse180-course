<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<h2>Order vs. Disorder</h2>

<p>
There are many life lessons you learn when you use algorithmic thinking to
bring more order to your life.
</p>

<p>
What you are doing this week is being mindful of the order and disorder you
experience as part of your daily life.
</p>

<p>
For this exploration, think about the many things you do every day. You will
discover there are many algorithms you are using that you may not have
recognized before. Remember the example of getting dressed? What you&rsquo;re
looking for doesn&rsquo;t need to be more complicated than that.
</p>

<p>
Talk to the same people you did last week, or different people if you prefer,
to discover what algorithms they use. Use this as an opportunity to discuss
with them what you learned about yourself, and what you know about
algorithmic thinking so far. Once again, make sure you take notes on these
conversations you have outside of class.
</p>

<h2>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h2>

    <ul>
<li>Make sure you take notes on the conversations you have outside of class.</li>
<li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your discussion notes and
discoveries about the algorithms you found that you and those you love use to bring order to
your lives and make it better.</li>
