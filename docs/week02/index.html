    <h1>CSE 180: Week 02</h1>
    <p>Order vs. Disorder</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  In our lives we often experience periods of order and other periods when our lives seem to be a mess and disordered. During the times of disorder we 
  sometimes become very discouraged, stressed, anxious, and slip into depression. When we find ourselves heading in this direction, the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
  that answers for us. Brother Jackie Nygaard gave a <a href="https://www.byui.edu/devotionals/jackie-nygaard" target="_blank">devitional talk</a> in 2018 
  where he pointed out that the gospel contains algorithms that help us have order in our lives. He also taught how these algorithms help us, as part of our daily 
  lives, to learn and grow personally and spiritually.
</p>
<p>
  Brother Nygaard is not alone in making this connection. Elder Maxwell, an apostle, gave an address on <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1994/06/wisdom-and-order?lang=eng" target="_blank">creating order in our lives</a>. In it, he pointed out that wisdom and order work together and 
  when we apply them in our lives we gain clarity. This is especially important during those periods in our lives that seem out of control and full of disorder.
</p>
<p>
  Read both of articles. Ponder on how you use these and other algorithms to gain or help maintain order in your life.
