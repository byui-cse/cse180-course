	<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
    <p>You have two tasks this week.</p>
    <h2>Task 1: Make and Join a Team</h2>

<p>
Your first task is to join a team and inform the teacher who is on your team. Only one member of the team needs to inform the teacher. Do this BEFORE Friday's class.
</p>
<p>To be able to wisely form a team, it is important for you to get to know your classmates and find a few you wish to collaborate with during the semester. Use the discussion tool your instructor has chosen to tell others about yourself. Include the same kinds of information you would want to know about them so all of you can make an informed decision about who to team-up with. Mention your strengths and weaknesses (ex. programming, using unfamiliar technology, researching answers, abstract thinking).
</p>
<p>
Your initial post should be a few paragraphs long. Include in your posting a list of when you are available outside of class (possible meeting times of day and days of the week).
</p>
<p>
Use these postings and the discussion tool to arrange and join a team. Remember to inform your teacher who is on your team.
</p>

<p>
You and your team members will be accountable to each other for the
learning activities you do outside of class.
This accounting and peer-assessment will happen every Friday during our
scheduled class meetings. Expect to spend about 6 hours outside of class each week doing readings and performing interviews 
in order to be able to make a good accounting to your teammates.
</p>
<h2>Task 2: </h2>
<p>
    Your other task for this week is to watch <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_griffiths_3_ways_to_make_better_decisions_by_thinking_like_a_computer">
    this 12-minute TED Talk by Tom Griffiths</a>. There you will learn three ways to make better decisions &#x2014; by thinking like
    a computer! Take notes on this talk. You will share your thoughts with your team
    during class on Friday. Here is the gist:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you ever struggle to make decisions, here's a talk for you. Cognitive
scientist Tom Griffiths shows how we can apply the logic of computers to
untangle tricky human problems, sharing three practical strategies for making
better decisions â€” on everything from finding a home to choosing which
restaurant to go to tonight.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here are some questions to answer and a suggestion for getting the most out
of this activity:
</p>

<p>
Are any of these decision-making strategies already part of your <i>decidering</i>
machinery? (That&rsquo;s another way to say &ldquo;ways you make decisions&rdquo;!) Are they
used by anyone you know? Talk to people (not on your team or others in the
class) to understand how they are using them.
</p>

<p>
Here are some ideas to help you accomplish this task. Make sure to
take notes on any conversations you have (or record them for distilling into
notes later).
</p>

<ul>
<li>Interview friends, roommates, members of your immediate or extended
families, associates at work or church, etc.</li>
<li>Invite someone to watch the Tom Griffiths talk with you and
pause to talk about it during the talk or afterwards.</li>
<li>Answer these questions:
    <ul>
<li>Is the book coauthored by this speaker, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions-dp-1250118360/dp/1250118360/ref=as_li_tf_tl?tag=teco06-20&amp;ie=UTF8">Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions</a>,
one that you or anyone you talked to would be interested in reading?</li>
<li>Do you consider yourself an algorithmic thinker already? What evidence would
you give to someone who asked you if you think algorithmically?</li>
<li>Do you think anyone you talked to exemplifies algorithmic thinking? What do
they do that shows they think intentionally, providentially, and logically?</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to understand why your computer is doing what it&rsquo;s doing, remember
the computer is just following an algorithm somebody else created.
</p>

<p>
Here is a bonus for you since you are going to
be using computers in your career regardless of your major. If you&rsquo;re interested in getting the
computer to do your bidding instead of someone else's, consider majoring in computer science.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of your choice of major, algorithmic thinking will help you be successful in your career, your home, and your life.
