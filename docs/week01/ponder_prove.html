	<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<p>
Following the Ice-Breaker Activity, you will have had a chance to form a small
team. You and your team members will be accountable to each other for the
learning activities you do outside of class.
</p>

<p>
This accounting and peer-assessment will happen each Friday during our
scheduled class meeting. Expect to spend about 6 hours outside of class to be
able to make a good accounting this week, and every week until the
second-to-last week of the semester.
</p>

<p>
    Your main task for this week is to watch <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_griffiths_3_ways_to_make_better_decisions_by_thinking_like_a_computer">
    this 12-minute TED Talk by Tom Griffiths</a>. There you will learn three ways to make better decisions &#x2014; by thinking like
    a computer! Take notes on this talk. You will share your thoughts with your team
    during class on Friday. Here is the gist:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you ever struggle to make decisions, here's a talk for you. Cognitive
scientist Tom Griffiths shows how we can apply the logic of computers to
untangle tricky human problems, sharing three practical strategies for making
better decisions â€” on everything from finding a home to choosing which
restaurant to go to tonight.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here are some questions to answer and a suggestion for getting the most out
of this activity:
</p>

<p>
Are any of these decision-making strategies already part of your <i>decidering</i>
machinery? (That&rsquo;s another way to say &ldquo;ways you make decisions&rdquo;!) Are they
used by anyone you know? Talk to people (not on your team or others in the
class) to understand how they are using them.
</p>

<p>
Here are some ideas to help you accomplish this task. Make sure to
take notes on any conversations you have (or record them for distilling into
notes later).
</p>

<ul>
<li>Interview friends, roommates, members of your immediate or extended
families, associates at work or church, etc.</li>
<li>Invite someone to watch the Tom Griffiths talk with you and
pause to talk about it during the talk or afterwards.</li>
<li>Answer these questions:
    <ul>
<li>Is the book coauthored by this speaker, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions-dp-1250118360/dp/1250118360/ref=as_li_tf_tl?tag=teco06-20&amp;ie=UTF8">Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions</a>,
one that you or anyone you talked to would be interested in reading?</li>
<li>Do you consider yourself an algorithmic thinker already? What evidence would
you give to someone who asked you if you think algorithmically?</li>
<li>Do you think anyone you talked to exemplifies algorithmic thinking? What do
they do that shows they think intentionally, providentially, and logically?</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to understand why your computer is doing what it&rsquo;s doing, remember
the computer is just following an algorithm somebody else created.
</p>

<p>
Here is a bonus for you budding algorithmic thinkers, since you are going to
be using computers in your career. If you&rsquo;re interested in getting the
computer to do your bidding instead of theirs, consider majoring in computer
science!
</p>

<p>
Regardless of your choice of major, &ldquo;computational&rdquo; (another word for
algorithmic) thinking is for everyone!
</p>

<p>
Jeanette Wing is a stellar role model for you!
</p>

<p>
Read these two articles she wrote 10-years apart and take notes for discussion
with your team.
</p>

<p>
The first introduces <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf">Computational Thinking</a> by saying &ldquo;it represents a
universally applicable attitude and skill set everyone, not just computer
scientists, would be eager to learn and use.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The second &#x2014; well, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/computational-thinking-10-years-later/">read it</a> and see what you think!
