Each of our lives consists of a series of waypoints and choices.
This week you are learning about how to find the shortest path to
what you want to be or where you want to go with your life. Speaking
algorithmically, we&rsquo;re talking about graphs and paths.
</p>
<p>
    Below is an image of an graph. The image is made up of circles, called nodes, and arrows,
    called edges. At each node (circle) is a decision point. Take a look at the node labled 2.
    At node 2, a decision has to be made. The choice is to go to node 3 or node 4. Also, since
    the edges are arrows, you can't backtrack. You can't go from node 2 directly to node 1.
</p>
<p>
    You will notice, however, that you can get from node 2 to node 1 indirectly by first going to
    node 3, then node 0, and finally node 1. In any graph, if you can get from a node back to itself
    you have a cycle in your graph.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes the choices we make in our lives are undoable. Take a look at the graph below. It
    represents choices made when getting dressed. Notice there are no arrow heads on the edges.
    This is called an undirected graph. The graph is saying you can start with any node, let's
    say selecting a black t-shirt, then choose the red hat to go with it, change your mind, go back
    to the black t-shirt, and then select the white hat or no hat at all.

<p>
    Here is an example where you use graphs everyday. Let's say you are on BYU-Idaho's campus. A
    class you are in gets out. You now need to get to your next class. It's in a building
    across campus. How do you get from here to there? You have nodes where sidewalks intersect.
    The sidewalks themsevles are edges. You make a choice each time you reach a node (crosswalk
    intersection).
</p>
<p>You'd be supprised where you could <a href="https://youtu.be/TwHy2DuWB3k">apply graphs to solve problems</a>.</p>

<p>
The life lesson is:
</p>

<p>
Be efficient and effective by finding the best path to your goals in the
most beneficial way.
</p>

<p>
Your &ldquo;grad plan&rdquo; is meant to help you reach your goal of graduating with the
degree you want. In terms of efficiency and effectiveness, how good is your
current grad plan? The university requires you to use the &ldquo;grad planner&rdquo; tool.
Think of the many paths to graduation starting from where you are right now
as a graph. Now explore what the grad planner tool can do for you when you
keep this in mind. Also find the many other people and resources you have
at your disposal to help you graduate.
</p>

<p>
This is just one example. Your task is to figure out where you and
your acquaintances are using graphs and path-finding to improve your lives.
