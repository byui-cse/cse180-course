<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
This week's life lesson is:
</p>
<p>
Be efficient and effective by finding a good path to your goals in a vert beneficial way.
</p>
<p>Your first task is to evaluate your path to graduation. Your &ldquo;grad plan&rdquo; 
    is meant to help you reach your goal of graduating with the
degree you want. In terms of efficiency and effectiveness, how good is your
current grad plan? While the university requires you to use the &ldquo;grad planner&rdquo; tool,
YOU should use it to think about and explore the many paths to graduation starting from where you 
are right now. Those paths are part of the graph that is all classes and majors at BYUI. 
Explore what the grad planner tool can do for you when you
keep efficiency in mind. Also realize there are many other people and resources you have
at your disposal to help you explore and to graduate. Find them. They may be professors, councilors, bishops, 
friends, advisors, or any other employee of student of the university.
</p>

<p>
Your second task is to find other times and/or places where you and
your acquaintances are using graphs and path-finding to improve your lives.
