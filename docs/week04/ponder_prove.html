<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
Each of our lives consists of a series of waypoints and choices.
This week you are learning about how to find the shortest path to
what you want to be or where you want to go with your life. Speaking
algorithmically, we&rsquo;re talking about graphs and paths.
</p>

<p>
The life lesson is:
</p>

<p>
Be efficient and effective by finding the best path to your goals in the
most beneficial way.
</p>

<p>
Your &ldquo;grad plan&rdquo; is meant to help you reach your goal of graduating with the
degree you want. In terms of efficiency and effectiveness, how good is your
current grad plan? The university requires you to use the &ldquo;grad planner&rdquo; tool.
Think of the many paths to graduation starting from where you are right now
as a graph. Now explore what the grad planner tool can do for you when you
keep this in mind. Also find the many other people and resources you have
at your disposal to help you graduate.
</p>

<p>
This is just one example. Your task is to figure out where you and
your acquaintances are using graphs and path-finding to improve your lives.
