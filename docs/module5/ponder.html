<h1>Greedy algorithm performance </h1>
<div>
    <p>
        As we've talked about greedy algorithms, we've learned that they only focus on small pieces of information. In order to see how greedy can be good or bad, we need some algorithms to compare. Your task between now and the next class is to build 2 different algorithms for playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USEjXNCTvcc">Tic Tac Toe</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure your two algorithms are different and that you have step-by-step directions that someone in our class can follow to play the game. You will not need to include choosing who goes first, but you will need to handle if you are the 'X' player or the 'O' player.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try to make one of your algorithms greedy and one of your algorithms less greedy.
