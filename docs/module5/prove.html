        <h2>Greedy Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            Greedy algorithms, and especially greedy task scheduling, are the learning focus for this week. Your task is to figure out where you and your acquaintances have been using greedy algorithms, for good or ill, to govern your lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            The life lesson is to learn to better prioritize and execute tasks to minimize waste and staleness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Greedy algorithms are probably misnamed. A better name could be 'best guess' or 'local best choice' algorithms. They don't use some sort of global, know everything data set. Instead, they look only at what is immediately in front of them and make a choice. Somewhat like you and I do in everyday life. I don't know everything about choices I have to make. Only the Lord can see all of that. Therefore I do my best to make a reasonable choice based on what I do know.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, when I'm shopping I have to choose which set of apples to buy. I don't know how my choice will affect those who come along after me to buy apples. There is really no way I could know. Now if there is someone picking apples at the same time I am, I can take into account what I see as their needs, but not that person that will be picking apples in an hour. I just have to do my best.
        </p>
        <h2>Greedy Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
            Getting tasks done is always a problem. That's why we're going to look at them as an example of greedy algorithms, but if you put on your creativity-hat you'll find them being used in lots of situations.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Tasks always have a deadline, even if it seems a long time away and may even be vague or flexible. Sooner or later, they just have to be completed or abandoned. How then can tasks be scheduled in some sort of 'good' way? Good has quotes around it here because it can mean different things to different people in different situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, are some tasks more important than others? Does completing some of the tasks make it easier to complete the others? Are there some that are more fun? There are so many ways of stating what good means in this type of situation. Any of these, and many more, are valid.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the way you would schedule the completing of tasks depends on your goals.
        </p>

        <h2>Task Summary</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Teach your friend what greedy algorithms are</li>
            <li>Have your friend identify one algorithm in your life that is a bit greedy</li>
            <li>
                Discuss with them why the algorithm is greedy
                <ul>
                    <li>What factors that go into your algorithm are you considering and what factors you are ignoring?</li>
                    <li>What are some pros and cons for keeping this algorithm greedy vs making it less greedy?</li>
                    <li>Assuming this algorithm should be made "better", what steps you will take to make your greedy algorithm "better"?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Identify one algorithm in your friend's life that is a bit greedy</li>
            <li>
                Discuss with them why the algorithm is greedy
                <ul>
                    <li>What factors that go into your algorithm are you considering and what factors you are ignoring?</li>
                    <li>What are some pros and cons for keeping this algorithm greedy vs making it less greedy?</li>
                    <li>Assuming this algorithm should be made "better", what steps you will take to make your greedy algorithm "better"?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Take these 2 algorithms and write out the discrete steps</li>
            <li>Identify the <em><strong>n</strong></em> in the algorithms to evaluate performance</li>
            <li>Document the Big O efficiency for each algorithm. The easiest way to check if your Big O is correct is to increase the number of <strong><em>n</em></strong> items by a little and then by a lot to see how much longer it takes</li>

        </ol>
