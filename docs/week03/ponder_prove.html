<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
    The life lesson this week is on the importance of and need for preparation, or
    what <a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits.html">Dr. Stephen R. Covey</a>
    (and others) have called saw-sharpening, which doing first makes sawing much more effective.
</p>

<p>
Ponder Doctrine and Covenants 88:119, and as commanded in the scriptures,
liken it to yourself. One way of doing this is to substitute &ldquo;life&rdquo; for &ldquo;house&rdquo;
since our lives need to be holy like the temple is holy.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a <i>life</i>, even
a <i>life</i> of prayer, a <i>life</i> of fasting, a <i>life</i> of faith, a <i>life</i> of learning,
a <i>life</i> of glory, a <i>life</i> of <b>order</b>, a <i>life</i> of God;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In class we are investigating the difference between disordered and ordered
search. You will see how beneficial (even necessary) sorting beforehand is in
order to take advantage of that difference. It reduces the time it takes to
find something. Specifically, you are learning about how to use binary search
to do this, as opposed to just looking at everything (linear search).
</p>

<p>
Your task this week is to figure out where you and your acquaintances are
using &ldquo;presorting&rdquo; to improve the finding and deciding algorithms you use in
your daily lives.
