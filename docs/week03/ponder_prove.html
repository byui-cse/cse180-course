    <h1>CSE 180: Week 03</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>


<p>
This week we are investigating the difference between disordered and ordered
search. You will see how beneficial (even necessary) sorting beforehand is in
order to take advantage of that difference. It reduces the time it takes to
find something. Specifically, you are learning about how to use binary search
to do this, as opposed to just looking at everything (linear search).
</p>

<p>
Your task this week is to figure out where your acquaintances are
using &ldquo;presorting&rdquo; to improve the finding and deciding algorithms you use in
your daily lives.

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
            <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
