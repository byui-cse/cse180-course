    <h1>CSE 180: Week 03</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>

<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>


<p>
This week we are investigating the difference between disordered and ordered
search. You will see how beneficial (even necessary) sorting beforehand is in
order to take advantage of that difference. It reduces the time it takes to
find something. Specifically, you are learning about how to use binary search
to do this, as opposed to just looking at everything (linear search).
</p>

<p>
Your task this week is to figure out where you and your acquaintances are
using &ldquo;presorting&rdquo; to improve the finding and deciding algorithms you use in
your daily lives.
