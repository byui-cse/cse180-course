    <h1>CSE 180: Week 10</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
This week you will begin to explore how to use calculation to assess and
classify way-point and choosing algorithms by their efficiency. These are often called shortest path algorithms.
</p>

<p>
When you have a task to perform, what is the shortest path to completion of
that task?
</p>

<p>
For a hypothetical (certainly not real!) example: In high school, suppose
you were bad &#x2014; maybe you split an infinitive, or used the passive voice &#x2014;
and the teacher made you go up to the board and write &ldquo;The passive voice will
not be used by me.&rdquo; 100 times. A silly example, perhaps, but what is a fast
way to do that? If you can use a computer and a word processing program, then
think about the slow way &#x2014; typing that sentence a hundred times &#x2014; versus
the fast way: typing it once, copying it, then pasting it 99 more times.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the fastest way would be to somehow tell your word processor
program how many times to paste and then have it do all the pasting for you!
</p>

<p>
    Show someone the <a href="images/usa-shortest-path.png">USA graph</a>
    and ask them to think about how they would find the shortest path (driving-distance-wise) from Sacramento California
    to Augusta Maine.
</p>

<p>
Observe their process, figure out what algorithm they were using. Figure out the complexity of their algorithm and compare
it to that of your own.
</p>
<p>
    Also, calculate the O-complexity of the algorithms you collected during week 4. Could any of these algorithms be improved?
</p>

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
            <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
