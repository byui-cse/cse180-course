    <p>
        This week&rsquo;s life lesson is:
    </p>
    <p>
        Be efficient and effective by finding a good path to your goals in a very beneficial way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your first task is to evaluate your path to graduation. Your &ldquo;grad plan&rdquo; is meant to help you reach your goal of graduating with the degree you want. In terms of efficiency and effectiveness, how good is your current grad plan? While the university requires you to use the &ldquo;grad planner&rdquo; tool, YOU should use it to think about and explore the many paths to graduation starting from where you are right now. Those paths are part of the graph that is all classes and majors at BYU-Idaho. Explore what the grad planner tool can do for you when you keep efficiency in mind. Also realize there are many other people and resources you have at your disposal to help you explore and to graduate. Find them. They may be professors, counselors, bishops, friends, advisors, or any other employee or student of the university.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your second task is to build a graph for how an acquaintance plans a trip. Have your friend describe the choices that they made in their plan and why they made them, and then incorporate them into your graph. Your graph should encompass choices that they could have made, but didn't choose. Highlight the their actual choices on the graph.
    </p>
    <p>
        This week, we also looked at algorithms for finding the shortest path. Sometimes this involves physical distance, but other times, this is the shortest series of steps to accomplish a goal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your third task is to write down one of your long term goals and one path that takes you to that goal. Then, add in additional choices for each intermediate step between where you are now and the goal. Be specific in your possible choices - don't just include opposites of the choice that you first see to accomplish your goal. Include other paths that may lead to your goal. For example, maybe your goal is to own your own business. One path is to start from scratch with a business plan. Another option would be to work for Chick-fil-a so that you can buy a franchise license. Some of the intermediate steps would be working for Chick-fil-a, get a business loan, open your own restaurant, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your last task is to show someone the <a href="images/usa-shortest-path-1.png">USA graph</a> and ask them to think about how they would find the shortest path (driving-distance-wise) from Sacramento California to Augusta Maine. Each node represents a capital of the state and each edge is the driving distance between each of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Observe their process, figure out what algorithm they were using. Figure out the complexity of their algorithm and compare it to that of your own.

    <h2>Algorithm for doing this task</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There's 2 individual tasks and 2 tasks to accomplish with friends, family members, or roommates
            <ul><li>Take notes while you talk with your friends so that you can put your thoughts into a report</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Individual tasks:
            <ul>
                <li>Look at your path to graduation. Put in your report your plan for how to get there</li>
                <li>Identify a long term goal and create several possible paths to get there. Include insights about strengths and weaknesses of each approach</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tasks with others:
            <ul>
                <li>Build a graph of how your acquaintance has planned a trip in the past. Include decisions they considered but did not choose in the graph. Highlight the path that they chose in the graph for the trip that they took</li>
                <li>Take a look at the graph representing distance between state capitols. Have your acquaintance find the shortest path from CA (Sacramento, California) to ME (Augusta, Maine). Determine their algorithm and calculate the Big O (Hint: how much longer would it take to find the shortest path if there were twice as many nodes or edges?)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Combine your notes into a report that you will share with your classmates during class next Wednesday</li>
        <li>
            Your report should include
            <ul>
                <li>Who you talked with</li>
                <li>Graph for your grad plan & insights about it</li>
                <li>Graph for your personal long term goal & insights about it</li>
                <li>Graph for your acquaintance's trip planning & insights about it</li>
                <li>Steps of the algorithm that your acquaintance used to find the shortest path from CA to ME</li>
                <li>Big O for the shortest path algorithm</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Submit your report to the Module 4 Graphs &amp; Choices Report <strong>before</strong> class</li>
        <li>Attend class on Wednesday to share your report with 4-5 of your classmates</li>
    </ol>
