    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>

<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
This week&rsquo;s life lesson is:
</p>
<p>
Be efficient and effective by finding a good path to your goals in a very beneficial way.
</p>
<p>Your first task is to evaluate your path to graduation. Your &ldquo;grad plan&rdquo; 
    is meant to help you reach your goal of graduating with the
degree you want. In terms of efficiency and effectiveness, how good is your
current grad plan? While the university requires you to use the &ldquo;grad planner&rdquo; tool,
YOU should use it to think about and explore the many paths to graduation starting from where you 
are right now. Those paths are part of the graph that is all classes and majors at BYU-Idaho. 
Explore what the grad planner tool can do for you when you
keep efficiency in mind. Also realize there are many other people and resources you have
at your disposal to help you explore and to graduate. Find them. They may be professors, counselors, bishops, 
friends, advisors, or any other employee or student of the university.
</p>

<p>
Your second task is to find other times and/or places where you and
your acquaintances are using graphs and path-finding to improve your lives.

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
            <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Include in your report notes on your grad planner explorations.</li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
