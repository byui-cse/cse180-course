    <h1>CSE 180: Module 4</h1>
    <p>Initial Grade Claim</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Ponder your experience in the class and write a self-assessment paragraph, including the grade you will claim for the course if it was to end today, taking into consideration the tasks completed, the feedback you got from your peers, your attendance, and the definitions of A, B, C, and D below, and how they relate to the outcomes from the class found in the syllabus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't write an epistle. Write <em>1 paragraph</em> of explicit, well documented evidences as to why the grade you are claiming is the correct grade for you this semester.
    </p>
    <p>
        My algorithm for evaluating the grade claim is as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Read your grade claim</li>
            <li>
                Review your peer evaluations from your tasks
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with 'A' grade</li>
                    <li>Drop one letter grade for each missing task</li>
                    <li>Drop one -/+ level for each 20% or so of absences</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Verify that you've achieved the course objectives with a combination of the following
                <ul>
                    <li>Check final project</li>
                    <li>Examine other task reports</li>
                    <li>Discuss key concepts with you</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some ideas you could use to create a well-formed, well-written grade claim.
    </p>
    <ul class="org-ul">
        <li>What algorithm did you understand the best?</li>
        <li>What exploration of an algorithm did you enjoy the most?</li>
        <li>What algorithm do you wish you understood better?</li>
        <li>During the explorations you did in this class, what algorithms did you see
            people use most frequently?</li>
        <li>Why do you think you have become (or not become) a stronger algorithmic
            thinker?</li>
        <li>Based on your understanding of the algorithms you learned about in this
            class, and the feedback you have received from your teammates, which grade
            best describes you?</li>
      <ul>
          <li><p>
              "A" represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of
              subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of
              concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates
              diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in
              serving other students.
              </p></li>
          <li><p>
              "B" represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and
              incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be successful
              in next level courses, graduate school or employment. The student participates
              in the Learning Model as applied in the course.
             <p></li>
          <li><p>
              "C" represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student
              demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses
              could be attempted but mastering new materials might prove challenging. The
              student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.
              </p></li>
          <li><p>
              "D" represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and
              apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to
              prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.
             </p></li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
