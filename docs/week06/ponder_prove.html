We are learning about compression algorithms this week.
</p>

<p>
The life lesson is to learn to eliminate waste &#x2014; compress the redundancy
(uselessness) out of your life.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sin is waste. It is doing one thing when you should be doing other and
better things for which you have the capacity. Hence, there are no innocent
idle thoughts. That is why even the righteous must repent, constantly and
progressively, since all fall short of their capacity and calling.
&#x2014; Hugh Nibley, <i>Zeal Without Knowledge</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Find and read the whole essay quoted from above. Be prepared to discuss it.
</p>

<p>
Figure out where you waste your life or your resources, and begin to formulate
a plan, even an algorithm, to eliminate that waste.
</p>

<p>
Talk to your acquaintances who have followed prophetic counsel to store food
and other essentials.
</p>

<p>
Investigate how much food storage gets wasted. How and why is there so much
waste?
