    <h1>CSE 180: Week 08</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>
  </div>

<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
This week you will begin to explore how to use calculation to assess and
classify sorting algorithms by their efficiency.
</p>

<p>
In class you learned the basics of O-notation (Order of growth). You saw how
it pertains to the case where the algorithm can&rsquo;t get any worse.
(Mathematically, the &ldquo;worst possible case&rdquo; is actually easier to analyze than
a &ldquo;typical case.&rdquo;)
</p>

<p>
You also learned about the bubble sort and the merge sort algorithms.
</p>

<p>
To compare two sorting algorithms, you need an objective measure of the work
each does. Say that the unit of work is to compare one item in a collection
of items to another. Doing this work tells you if one item comes before or
after another. If so you must swap their order, or do nothing if they compare
the same.
</p>

<p>
Do this experiment. Shuffle a standard deck of cards. Give someone who is
not in the class the deck and ask them to sort the cards by looking at each
card one at a time. Count the number of times they compare one card to another.
</p>

<p>
See if you can figure out what algorithm they&rsquo;re using, and what the
O-notation for it would be.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to measure the total work they do and relate that to the size of
their sorting task (the number of cards in this case).
</p>

<p>
    Also figure out the O-notation for the algorithms you collected during week 2.

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
            <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
