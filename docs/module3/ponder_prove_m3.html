<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    This week we are investigating the difference between disordered and ordered search. You will see how beneficial (even necessary) beforehand is in order to take advantage of that difference. It reduces the time it takes to find something. Specifically, you are learning about how to use binary search to do this, as opposed to just looking at everything (linear search).
  </p>
  <p>
    You also explored how to use calculation to assess and classify how sorting before applying an algorithm makes search algorithms more efficient, and by how much.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your first task is to figure out where your acquaintances are using &ldquo;presorting&rdquo; to improve the finding and deciding algorithms you use in your daily lives. Record their algorithm for sorting and see if you can calculate how much time they save in a given week or month by having sorted something that they use. Did they learn anything from the process?
  </p>
  <p>
    Your second task is to help an acquaintance organize their school work on their computer. The goal of the organization is to make finding and retrieving documents and programs faster. In preparation for helping your acquaintance organize their computer, take some time to organize your documents and programs that you have on your computer. Do you have all of your assignments in the Downloads folder? How can you make finding work from previous semesters easier?
  </p>
  <p>
    Be sure to identify the <strong><em>n</em></strong> and the Big O efficiency for each of these sorting and finding algorithms.

  <h2>Algorithm for doing this task</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>
          Interview one or two friends, family members, or roommates
          <ul><li>Take notes so that you can write a report later</li></ul>
      </li>
      <li>Obtain one algorithm where your acquaintance sorts to help with finding or deciding. Record the steps for the sorting algorithm. This may be something that they use already, or something that they intent to implement.</li>
      <li>Make sure your school work is organized on your computer</li>
      <li>Help your acquaintance sort school work on their computer</li>
      <li>Combine your notes into a report that you will share with your classmates during class next Wednesday</li>
      <li>
          Your report should include
          <ul>
              <li>Who you talked with</li>
              <li>The discrete steps of the algorithms your acquaintances' algorithms</li>
              <li>What the <em><strong>n</strong></em> refers to when talking about the efficiency of the algorithm</li>
              <li>The Big O notation for the efficiency of the algorithm</li>
              <li>Insights about why they do it that way or how could they improve the algorithm</li>
              <li>How much time they save by organizing beforehand</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Submit your report to the Week 3 Ordering Report assignment <strong>before</strong> class</li>
      <li>Attend class on Wednesday to share your report with 4-5 of your classmates</li>
  </ol>
