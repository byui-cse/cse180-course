<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
This week you will begin to explore how to use calculation to assess and
classify shortest path algorithms by their efficiency.
</p>

<p>
When you have a task to perform, what is the shortest path to completion of
that task?
</p>

<p>
For a hypothetical (certainly not real!) example: In high school, suppose
you were bad &#x2014; maybe you split an infinitive, or used the passive voice &#x2014;
and the teacher made you go up to the board and write &ldquo;The passive voice will
not be used by me.&rdquo; 100 times. A silly example, perhaps, but what is a fast
way to do that? If you can use a computer and a word processing program, then
think about the slow way &#x2014; typing that sentence a hundred times &#x2014; versus
the fast way: typing it once, copying it, then pasting it 99 more times.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the fastest way would be to somehow tell your word processor
program how many times to paste and then have it do all the pasting for you!
</p>

<p>
    Show someone the <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse180-course/week10/images/usa-shortest-path.png">USA graph</a>
    and ask them to think about how they would find the shortest path (driving-distance-wise) from Sacramento California
    to Augusta Maine, visiting all the other state capitals en route.
</p>

<p>
Observe their process, figure out what algorithm they were using, and compare
it to your own.

        <li>Make sure you take notes on the conversations you have outside of class.</li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your discussion notes and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated and assessed.</li>
