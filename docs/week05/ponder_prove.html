    <p>
        Greedy algorithms, and especially greedy task scheduling, are the learning
        focus for this week. Your task is to figure out where you and your acquaintances have been using
        greedy algorithms, for good or ill, to govern your lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        The life lesson is to learn to better prioritize and execute tasks to minimize waste and staleness.

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
            <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
