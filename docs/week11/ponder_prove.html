<h1>Your Tasks</h1>

<p>
    Goal this week: Explore how to use calculation to assess and classify greedy
    algorithms that somebody you know is using.
</p>
<p>
    Explore how to use calculation to assess and classify greedy algorithms that somebody you know and love is using.
    Remember young Gauss and how he cleverly added up the numbers 1 to 100? Your task this week is to teach someone you know and love how he did it, and in the process teach them an example that appears to prove the optimal efficiency of the greedy task-scheduling algorithm discussed in class.
</p>
<h2>Greedy Algorithms</h2>
<p>
    Greedy algorithms are probably misnamed. A better name could be 'best guess' or 'local best choice' algorithms. 
    They don't use some sort of global, know everything data set. Instead, they look only at what is immediately in front of them and make a choice. Somewhat like you and I do in everyday life. I don't know everything about 
    choices I have to make. Only the Lord can see all of that. Therefore I do my best to make a reasonable choice 
    based on what I do know.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when I'm shopping I have to choose which set of apples to buy. I don't know how my choice will 
    affect those who come along after me to buy apples. There is really no way I could know. Now if there is 
    someone picking apples at the same time I am, I can take into account what I see as their needs, but not 
    that person that will be picking apples in an hour. I just have to do my best.
</p>
<h2>Greedy Scheduling</h2>
<p>
    Getting tasks done is always a problem. That's why we're going to look at them as an example of greedy 
    algorithms, but if you put on your creativity-hat you'll find them being used in lots of situations.
</p>
<p> 
    Tasks always have a deadline, even if it seems a long time away and may 
    even be vague or flexible. Sooner or later, they just have to be completed or abandoned. How then can tasks be 
    scheduled in some sort of 'good' way? Good has quotes around it here because it can mean different things to 
    different people in different situations.
</p>
<p>
    For example, are some tasks more important than others? Does completing some of the tasks make it easier to 
    complete the others? Are there some that are more fun? There are so many ways of stating what good means 
    in this type of situation. Any of these, and many more, are valid.
</p>
<p>
    So the way you would schedule the completing of tasks depends on your goals.

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
            <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
