<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<h2>Order vs. Disorder</h2>

	<div>
<p>
    There are many life lessons you learn when you use algorithmic thinking to bring more order to your life.
</p>

<p>
    What you are doing this week is being mindful of the order and disorder you experience as part of your daily life.
</p>

<p>
    For this exploration, you will be finding algorithms that a friend, roommate or family member uses to make order in their life. They don't need to be too complicated - think how simple it was to make a favorite dessert. What you're looking for doesn't need to be more complicated than that, but you should find an algorithm that helps them produce order in their life. You should identify and write down the steps for 2 algorithms (either 2 algorithms from one person or 1 algorithm from two people). Write out the inputs, outputs, steps, and Big O notation for each algorithm.
</p>

<p>
    In class you have learned the basics of O-notation (Order of growth). You saw how it pertains to the case where the algorithm can&rsquo;t get any worse. (Mathematically, the &ldquo;worst possible case&rdquo; is actually easier to analyze than a &ldquo;typical case.&rdquo;)
</p>
    
<p>
    You also learned about the bubble sort and the merge sort algorithms.
</p>
    
<p>
    To compare two sorting algorithms, you need an objective measure of the work
    each does. Say that the unit of work is to compare one item in a collection
    of items to another. Doing this work tells you if one item comes before or
    after another. If so you must swap their order, or do nothing if they compare
    the same.
</p>
    
<p>
    Do this experiment. Shuffle a standard deck of cards. Give someone who is
    not in the class the deck and ask them to sort the cards by looking at each
    card one at a time. Count the number of times they compare one card to another.
</p>
    
<p>
    See if you can figure out what algorithm they&rsquo;re using, and what the
    O-notation for it would be.
</p>
    
    <p> 
    The idea is to measure the total work they do and relate that to the size of
    their sorting task (the number of cards in this case).
</p>

    <h2>Algorithm for doing this task</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Interview one or two friends, family members, or roommates
            <ul><li>Take notes so that you can write a report later</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Obtain 2 algorithms that produce order in their life that they've never realized before</li>
        <li>Record the individual steps so that someone else could repeat the algorithm</li>
        <li>Observe their sorting of a deck of cards - counting the number of comparisons</li>
        <li>Combine your notes into a report that you will share with your classmates during class next Wednesday (or Thursday)</li>
        <li>
            Your report should include
            <ul>
                <li>Who you talked with</li>
                <li>The discrete steps of the algorithms your acquaintances' algorithms</li>
                <li>What the <em><strong>n</strong></em> refers to when talking about the efficiency of the algorithm</li>
                <li>The Big O notation for the efficiency of the algorithm</li>
                <li>Insights about why they do it that way or how could they improve the algorithm</li>
                <li>The number of comparisons made during the card sorting activity and the Big O efficiency</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Submit your report to the Module 2 Ordering Report assignment <strong>before</strong> class</li>
        <li>Attend class on Wednesday (or Thursday) to share your report with 4-5 of your classmates</li>
    </ol>
