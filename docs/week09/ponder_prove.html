    <h1>CSE 180: Week 09</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
This week you will begin to explore how to use calculation to assess and
classify how sorting before applying an algorithm makes search algorithms
more efficient, and by how much.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Avoidance strategies&rdquo; are all about avoiding work, or learning to do it
faster and better. For example, learning from washing each dish how to wash
the next one faster.
</p>

<p>
Find some examples of avoidance strategies. (You could google this.) Then ask
someone to sort their junk drawer. Observe their process. Is it random or
deliberate and systematic?
</p>

<p>
Did they learn anything other than that they have a lot of junk?
</p>

<p>
Help them see that having sorted their junk, the next time they put something
in that drawer it will be far easier to keep it organized.
</p>
<p>
    Also figure out the O-complexity of the algorithms you collected during week 3.

<h3>How to Fulfill Return-and-Report Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        Make sure you take notes and write a report for your teammates on the conversations you have outside of class. Here are some ideas you can use to improve the quality of the report.
        <ul>
            <li>What are your relationships to the people you interviewed?</li>
            <li>What are the detailed, discrete, algorithm steps they used?</li>
            <li>Why did they choose to do it that way?</li>
            <li>What are your ideas for how they could improve this algorithm?</li>
        </ul>
        Do not limit yourself to these questions.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare to share with your classroom team your report and
            discoveries about the algorithms you investigated.
        </li>
    </ul>
