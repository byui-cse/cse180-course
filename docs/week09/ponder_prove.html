<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<div>
<p>
This week you will begin to explore how to use calculation to assess and
classify how sorting before applying an algorithm makes search algorithms
more efficient, and by how much.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Avoidance strategies&rdquo; are all about avoiding work, or learning to do it
faster and better. For example, learning from washing each dish how to wash
the next one faster.
</p>

<p>
Find some examples of avoidance strategies. (You could google this.) Then ask
someone to sort their junk drawer. Observe their process. Is it random or
deliberate and systematic?
</p>

<p>
Did they learn anything other than that they have a lot of junk?
</p>

<p>
Help them see that having sorted their junk, the next time they put something
in that drawer it will be far easier to keep it organized.
