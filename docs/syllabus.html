            <h1>Algorithmic Thinking</h1>
            <p>CSE 180</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h1>Syllabus</h1>
    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
        In this course you will have the opportunity to gain the knowledge and
        practice required to design and apply algorithms to solve personal and
        spiritual challenges you have in your life, and help others apply the same
        to their lives. This course builds your ability to see yourself as a logical,
        algorithmic thinker, with power and ability to make good, defensible decisions
        and communicate your thinking to others, along with why the decisions you have
        made are good.
    </p>
    <h3>Design Principles</h3>
    <p>
        This course is based on one underlying principle; namely, that you are a
        dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ and therefore you would never lie or make
        deceptive claims regarding your understanding of the course material. Nor
        would you lie or deceive regarding completion of the tasks you will be
        assigned. Other principles include:
    <ul>
        <li>lifting others in the class;</li>
        <li>using your agency;</li>
        <li>showing empathy and love; and</li>
        <li>being humble enough to ask for help from your teacher and others in the class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Many tasks assigned to you in this course are to be completed in teams.
        Your instructor will inform you regarding team creation. It is also true
        that you will never be given a team grade. You will be accountable to
        your team, and will report to them during class meetings (but never
        outside of class) the results of your investigations and collaborations
        outside of class. But no tasks done outside of class will be
        instructor- or peer-reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teamwork is part of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model, and indeed, it is part
        of the Plan of Salvation. All of us here on earth work together to aid
        each other in achieving salvation and exaltation, yet we are
        individually responsible for our own salvation and exaltation. Nobody
        makes it to the Celestial Kingdom because they belonged to a group of
        good people. Neither should you expect to get an A just because you are
        part of a group of hardworking students that come to understand the
        topics of this course and are able to apply them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, when you are helping someone you should never give them your own work.
        Neither should you expect someone to give you theirs when you ask them for help.
        Instead, help those who will come to you by talking over how they are
        thinking about and approaching their tasks, showing them how to search for
        and find answers, and be loving and supportive. In other words, teach them
        just like you would teach someone the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Love them,
        help them find their own answers, and lead them to the scriptures.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>None.</p>
    <h3>Platforms, Requirements, and Resources</h3>
    <p>
        You will need a laptop computer running MacOS, Windows, or Linux.
        Internet connectivity is also required.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no text, all readings are found in iLearn or the BYU-Idaho Library.
    </p>
    <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
    <p>
        When you successfully complete this course, you will be able to:
    <ol>
        <li>Create algorithms to achieve specific goals</li>
        <li>Recognize existing algorithms in everyday life</li>
        <li>Identify the characteristics of algorithms</li>
        <li>Decompose algorithms into discrete steps</li>
        <li>Improve algorithms</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Course Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The first week will be an introduction (Module 1), followed by 2-week modules that will help organize our exploration of algorithms in our lives and as they apply to problems that we will solve in our careers. Halfway through, you'll have the opportunity to do a "Grade Claim" where you meet 1-1 with the instructor to claim the grade that best represents your progress. The last module will be documenting and showing that you can apply the principles we've learned throughout the semester and have a "Final Grade Claim" with the instructor. The initial grade claim is worth 10% and the final grade claim is the other 90% of the grade.
    </p>

    <h3>Assessments</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Week 1 (Module 1)
            <p>
                We'll explore the concept of an algorithm and figure out where we see them in our life. We'll also look
                at how to tell if one algorithm is better than another using Big O notation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Weeks 2 &amp; 3 (Module 2) - Algorithms for Ordering</li>
        <li>Weeks 4 &amp; 5 (Module 3) - Algorithms for Ordered Searching</li>
        <li>Weeks 6 &amp; 7 (Module 4) - Algorithms for Making Choices
            <p>You'll have an initial grade claim that is 10% of your final grade.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Weeks 8 &amp; 9 (Module 5) - Greedy Algorithms</li>
        <li>Weeks 10 &amp; 11 (Module 6) - Algorithms for Eliminating Waste</li>
        <li>Weeks 12 &amp; 14 (Module 7) - Algorithms You Use
            <p>
                You will ponder your experience in the class and write a self-assessment report, including the final grade you will claim for the course, taking into account your peers&rsquo; evaluations of your work. You will also consider attendance as it is required throughout the semester. This will account for 90% of your final grade in the course.
            </p>

    <h3>From the University Catalog</h3>
    <p>
        As you assess your learning for your final grade claim, apply these
        definitions from the catalog.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                “A” represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of
                subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of
                concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates
                diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in
                serving other students.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                “B” represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and
                incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be successful
                in next level courses, graduate school or employment. The student participates
                in the Learning Model as applied in the course.
            <p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                “C” represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student
                demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses
                could be attempted but mastering new materials might prove challenging. The
                student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                “D” represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and
                apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to
                prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                “F” represents failure in the course.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
