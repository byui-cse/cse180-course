    <h1>CSE 180: Week 07</h1>
    <p>Ponder and Prove</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1>Project Week!</h1>
<div>
<p>
    As your project this week you will discover and appropriately describe
    algorithms others you know and love use in their lives. Select at least one interesting
    algorithm from each type of algorithm we have seen during the previous weeks (one per week).
    Describe each of these algorithms in deep detail as discrete steps of the overall algorithm. Be thorough in your
    investigations.
</p>
<p>
    You are doing this in preparation for weeks 8 - 14 where you will attempt to measure the efficiency of these algorithms.
    Make sure your steps are actually describable and aren't composed of sub-steps and are not vague.

</p>
<p>
    Write up each of the algorithms for the report to be shared with your group on Friday. Include the type of algorithm, how it
    is being used by the person you love, why they use it, and the discrete steps.
</p>
<p>
    On Friday, come prepared to examine your group members' algorithm descriptions and help them see any hidden vagueness or missed
    sub-steps.
