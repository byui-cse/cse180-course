        <h2>Reducing Waste</h2>
        <p>
            Compression algorithms are more than just storing things in a different format. You are trading some CPU time for reduced storage space. In our lives, we can use a similar process of using more planning time to reduce waste in different areas of our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we explored greedy algorithms during the last module, you identified and had identified in your life an algorithm that was a bit greedy. Some of your greedy algorithms were exactly opposite the compression algorithms. Greedy algorithms trade less planning or processing for a less optimal result.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, you are finding algorithms in <em><b>others</b></em> lives. You will have a chance during our next task to focus on your own life; however, for this week, you must talk to <b>2 or 3</b> <em>different</em> people. We are exploring how to reduce waste in 3 areas: food, money, and time.
        </p>
        <h4>Food</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For exploring reducing waste in food, look for acquaintances who have followed prophetic counsel to store food and other essentials. Is there an opportunity to reduce waste?</li>
            <li>If you can't find an acquaintance who currently has a food storage, how else do friends and family waste food? Do they buy too much and end of throwing it away? What algorithms in their life lead to these decisions?</li>
            <li>Task:
                <ol>
                    <li>Talk with an acquaintance about either a food storage algorithm or another food waste algorithm that you can help with</li>
                    <li>Identify how the selected algorithm could be compressed using planning or processing to reduce food waste</li>
                    <li>Write the discrete steps for the algorithm which causes waste</li>
                    <li>Write the discrete steps for an improved algorithm that includes planning or processing (compression)</li>
                    <li>Determine the Big O of the algorithms</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Money</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Talk to an acquaintance about ways in which they waste money. Does it relate to buying more expensive items or by buying cheaper items that don't last? Does it involve traveling in a more expensive way?</li>
            <li>Although you could say that wasting food and time is also wasting money, try to focus on direct ways other than food and time for this algorithm.</li>
            <li>Discuss the algorithm and choices that cause money to be wasted. For example, I like to run my tire pressure a little low in my tires to make the ride more comfortable, and that causes them to wear out faster. My algorithm would include my choice and some of the factors of when I want the pressure low or not. An improved algorithm may be to only lower my pressure when I'm going to an area that is off-highway where I would want a smoother ride, but filling the tires back up when I'm just driving on the street.</li>
            <li>Task:
                <ol>
                    <li>Talk with an acquaintance about a money wasting algorithm</li>
                    <li>Identify the algorithm that could be compressed using planning or processing to reduce money wasted</li>
                    <li>Write the discrete steps for the algorithm which causes waste</li>
                    <li>Write the discrete steps for an improved algorithm that includes planning or processing (compression)</li>
                    <li>Determine the Big O of the algorithms</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Time</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Talk to an acquaintance about ways in which they waste time. Sometimes we do things that must be done over because we don't do it well enough the first time.</li>
            <li>Make sure you're talking about wasted time versus poor decision making - even though often poor choices can lead to wasted time</li>
            <li>What is the algorithm that your friend uses that wastes time? How can planning ahead help reduce the wasted time?</li>
            <li><b>If planning ahead doesn't save any time, find a new wasteful algorithm</b></li>
            <li>Task:
                <ol>
                    <li>Talk with an acquaintance about a time wasting algorithm</li>
                    <li>Identify the algorithm that could be compressed using planning or processing to reduce time wasted</li>
                    <li>Write the discrete steps for the algorithm which causes waste</li>
                    <li>Write the discrete steps for an improved algorithm that includes planning or processing</li>
                    <li>Determine the Big O of the algorithms</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Task Summary</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Talk with two or three friends - the algorithms cannot come from just one person</li>
            <li>Identify an algorithm where your friend wastes food</li>
            <li>Identify an algorithm where your friend wastes money</li>
            <li>Identify an algorithm where your friend wastes time</li>
            <li>List in your report for each category (food, money, &amp; time):
                <ul>
                    <li>Who you talked with</li>
                    <li>Discrete steps for the algorithm before compression</li>
                    <li>Discrete steps for the algorithm after "compression"</li>
                    <li>Big O efficiency before and after (remember to defend why it's correct)</li>
                    <li>Insights you gained from this person and algorithm... What is interesting about it?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
