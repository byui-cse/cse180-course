    <h1>Algorithmic Thinking</h1>
    <p>CSE 180</p>
  </div>
</div>
	<h1>Syllabus</h1>
	<h3>Course Description</h3>
	<p>
      In this course you will have the opportunity to gain the knowledge and
      practice required to design and apply algorithms to solve personal, spiritual,
      and personal challenges you have in your life, and help others apply the same
      to their lives. This course builds your ability to see yourself as a logical,
      mathematical thinker, with power and ability to make good, defensible decisions
      and communicate your thinking to others, along with why the decisions you have
      made are good.
  </p>
	<h3>Design Principles</h3>
	<p>
      This course is based on one underlying principle; namely, that you are a
		  dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ and therefore you would never lie or make
		  deceptive claims regarding your understanding of the course material. Nor
		  would you lie or deceive regarding completion of the tasks you will be
		  assigned. Other principles include:<ul>
			<li>lifting others in the class;</li>
			<li>using your agency;</li>
			<li>showing empathy and love; and</li>
			<li>being humble enough to ask for help from your teacher and others in the class.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All tasks assigned to you in this course are to be completed in teams. Your
        instructor will inform you regarding team creation. It is also true that you
        will never be given a team grade. All of us here on earth work together to
        aid each other in achieving salvation and exaltation, yet we are individually
        responsible for our own salvation and exaltation.
        Nobody makes it to the Celestial Kingdom because they belonged to a group of
        good people. Neither should you expect to get an A just because you are part of
        a group of hardworking students that come to understand the topics of this
        course and are able to apply them.
    </p>
		<p>Therefore, when you are helping someone you should never give them your own work.
        Neither should you expect someone to give you theirs when you ask them for help.
			  Instead, help those who will come to you by talking over how they are
			  thinking about and approaching their tasks, showing them how to search for
			  and find answers, and be loving and supportive. In other words, teach them
        just like you would teach someone the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Love them,
        help them find their own answers, and lead them to the scriptures.</p>

	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>None.</p>
	<h3>Platforms, Requirements, and Resources</h3>
	<p>
      You will need a laptop computer running  MacOS, Windows, or Linux.
      Internet connectivity is also required.
  </p>
  <p>
      There is no text, all readings are found in iLearn or the BYU-Idaho Library.
  </p>
	<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
	<p>
      When you successfully complete this course, you will be able to:
		<ol>
        <li>solve life-challenges where algorithmic thinking skills are needed to
            design and create an algorithm that can then be used to inform
            decisions or draw conclusions,</li>
        <li>use algorithmic thinking to assess what key variables are needed and
            to illuminate key assumptions made when creating and applying an
            algorithm to life-challenges,</li>
        <li>use self-designed algorithms to make informed decisions,</li>
        <li>interpret quantitative data regarding the quality of self-designed
            algorithms, and</li>
        <li>communicate self-designed algorithms to others in an efficient,
            mathematical, way.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Course Structure</h3>
	<p>
      This is a semester-long course. In weeks 1 through 6 you will have assigned
      readings and quizzes, and an interaction with other class members as you work
      to understand principles of algorithms and their application. You will
      discover and apply these algorithms in your life. In week 7 you will use what
      you have learned to help others by finding algorithms they use in their lives
      that they may not be aware of. In weeks 8 through 12 you will explore how to
      evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms you discovered in weeks 1 through 6
      to help you improve your use of them in your life. In week 13 you will explore
      the efficiency of the algorithms you found in week 7 to help others improve
      their lives. In week 14 you will report on the growth you have achieved over
      the semester due to your increased understanding of algorithms.
  </p>

	<h3>Assessments</h3>
	<p>
		  <ul>
          <li>Week 1
<p>
You will introduce yourself to the class and ponder how you can change your
attitude towards mathematics.
</p></li>
         <li>Week 2 through Week 6
<p>
You will take a quiz after completing the assigned reading, and you will
explore different types of algorithms.
</p></li>
        <li>Week 7
<p>
You will, as a project, discover and appropriately describe algorithms others
use in their lives.
</p></li>
        <li>Week 8 through Week 12
<p>
You will take a quiz after completing the assigned reading, and you will
explore how to use calculation to classify and assess algorithms by their
efficiency.
</p></li>
       <li>Week 13
<p>
You will, as a project, correctly evaluate for efficiency algorithms you have
discovered and described that others use in their daily educational,
spiritual, and personal lives, and suggest improved alternatives.
</p></li>
       <li>Week 14
<p>
You will ponder your experience in the class and write a self-assessment
report, including the final grade you will claim for the course.
</p></li>
		</ul>

  <h3>From the University Catalog</h3>
      <p>
          As you assess your learning for your grade calculation, apply these
          definitions from the catalog.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li><p>
              “A” represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of
              subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of
              concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates
              diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in
              serving other students.
              </p></li>
          <li><p>
              “B” represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and
              incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be successful
              in next level courses, graduate school or employment. The student participates
              in the Learning Model as applied in the course.
             <p></li>
          <li><p>
              “C” represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student
              demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses
              could be attempted but mastering new materials might prove challenging. The
              student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.
              </p></li>
          <li><p>
              “D” represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and
              apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to
              prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.
             </p></li>
          <li><p>
              “F” represents failure in the course.
          </p></li>
      </ul>
